Redux Async Queue
=============

Async queue [middleware](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html) for Redux.

```
npm install --save redux-async-queue
```
If you used ES modules
```js
import ReduxAsyncQueue from 'redux-async-queue' // no changes here ðŸ˜€
```
If you use CommonJS
```js
var ReduxAsyncQueue = require('redux-async-queue').default
```
If you need a UMD version
```js
var ReduxAsyncQueue = window.ReduxAsyncQueue.default
```

## What is it?

ReduxAsyncQueue [middleware](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/advanced/Middleware.md) makes queueing redux actions painless. This allows you to fire multiple actions simultaneously and have them execute asynchronously in order.

For example, let's say we are making burgers (because they're delicious!). We can only make one burger at a time, but our friends keep coming up and saying they want one. You have 10 requests, but can only make one at a time. Here is how we'd write that delicious example out with the ReduxAsyncQueue middleware.

```js
const MAKE_BURGER = 'MAKE_BURGER';

function makeBurger(ingredients) {
  return {
    type: MAKE_BURGER,
    payload: ingredients,
  };
}

function queueMakeBurger(style) {
  return {
    queue: MAKE_BURGER,
    callback: (next, dispatch, getState) => {
      getIncredients(style).then(incredients => {
        dispatch(makeBurger(ingredients));
        next();
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
}
```

You'll notice the `next()` call within `callback`. That is the key to letting ReduxAsyncQueue know that you are ready to start making the next burger. The `queue` key specifies to which queue this callback belongs. You may have several different queues for any given application.

## Installation

```
npm install --save redux-async-queue
```

To enable ReduxAsyncQueue, use [`applyMiddleware()`](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/applyMiddleware.html):

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import ReduxAsyncQueue from 'redux-async-queue';
import reducer from './reducers/index';

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  applyMiddleware(ReduxAsyncQueue)
);
```
